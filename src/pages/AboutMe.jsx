          Hi, I'm Myro and I am a fullstack developer! I love making things look
          amazing and functional on the web. I also love solving problems and
          helping others solve theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first taste of coding came in college with a course in C++ and
          MatLab. A Psychology degree and a restaurant management experience
          later, I am back in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently in a coding bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania
          working on a certificate in fullstack web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          After many debugging sessions later, I am loving it more than ever! I
          look forward to transforming your ideas into sustainable solutions.
